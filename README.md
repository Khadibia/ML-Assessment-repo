# Object Detection with YOLOv5

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting **four object classes** using a custom dataset:
- `remote`
- `tv`
- `chair`
- `table`

The dataset was annotated using [makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai) and exported in **YOLO format**.  
The trained model uses **YOLOv5** for object detection.
